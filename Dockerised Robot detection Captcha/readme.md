# Dockerised Robot Detection Captcha

While logging on to websites or download tasks we often get captcha verification to prove our selves as not a robot.

For this process we are often asked to select various pictures of traffic lights and restaurant fronts.

In this project I tried to dockerise this boring task but also improvised it so that it detects a person automatically through face detection.

Technologies used: 
1. Flask
2. HTML, CSS
3. OpenCV
4. Python
5. Docker

Mentor: Mr. Vimal Daga

Hope that you like my project. In future I will improve it and thought of deploying it too.
